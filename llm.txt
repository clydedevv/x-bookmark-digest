# X Bookmark Digest Project Plan

## App Overview
X Bookmark Digest is a tool for Twitter/X users to organize, tag, and digest their bookmarks. It allows users to import their Twitter bookmarks, automatically organize them, create custom reading digests, and generate AI-powered summaries.

## Current Approach
We've set up a modern full-stack application using:
- Next.js with App Router for the frontend
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for the database
- NextAuth.js for Twitter OAuth authentication
- Twitter API v2 for accessing bookmarks
- OpenAI API for AI-powered features (digests, categorization)

## Current Progress
1. ✅ Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. ✅ Defined database schema with Prisma (users, bookmarks, tags, digests, recipes)
3. ✅ Configured Twitter OAuth authentication with NextAuth
4. ✅ Created API endpoints for:
   - Fetching Twitter bookmarks
   - Storing bookmarks in database
   - Generating digests with OpenAI
5. ✅ Implemented OpenAI services for:
   - Summarizing bookmarks
   - Categorizing bookmarks by topic
6. ✅ Built basic UI components:
   - Navigation bar with auth state
   - Login page with Twitter sign-in
   - Home page with welcome message
   - Bookmarks page that displays user's bookmarks

## Remaining Tasks
1. Complete frontend components:
   - Digest creation/management UI
   - Tag management
   - Settings page
   - User profile
2. Integration with Notion/Sheets
3. Email digest scheduler
4. Recipe system for bookmark filtering
5. AI chat interface for bookmark interaction
6. Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Requirements
- Twitter API access (OAuth tokens)
- OpenAI API key
- PostgreSQL database
- Node.js environment

## User Flow
1. User logs in with Twitter
2. Imports bookmarks (one-click)
3. System auto-categorizes bookmarks
4. User can create digests (select bookmarks + schedule)
5. User receives digests via email and/or app
6. Optional sync to Notion/Sheets

## Key Features
1. Zero-friction import from Twitter bookmarks
2. AI-powered organization and tagging
3. Custom digest creation with scheduling
4. Reading time estimation
5. External integrations (Notion, Sheets)
6. Topic/author-based filtering
7. Chat with your bookmarks using AI
8. (Important) Generate action items, insights, and broad user profiles based on their bookmarks, it could even roast them
